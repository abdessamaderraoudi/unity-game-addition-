# Test Mini-Games

## Overview
The **Test Mini-Games** collection is a set of educational games designed to help students practice essential mathematical concepts across multiple grade levels. The mini-games cover topics ranging from reading numbers to solving real-world problems, with levels tailored to different student needs. These games incorporate interactive avatars, customizable difficulty settings, and speech-based input to enhance the learning experience.

## Important Update
### **New Features & Modifications:**
- **Parameterization of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division** based on retention and different difficulty levels.
- Operations must be solved **vertically and manually** in the game interface.
- **New interaction mechanisms** such as drag-and-drop for solving operations vertically.
- **2D Focus**: All projects will remain 2D, with no assigned 3D tasks for students.
- **Inspired by Duolingo**: Implementing gamification and interactive learning mechanisms.

### **Key Arithmetic Concepts Considered in Mini-Games**
#### **1. Addition**
- Carrying when sums exceed 9.
- Retaining carried values for the next column.
- Right-to-left solving approach.

#### **2. Subtraction**
- Borrowing when minuend digits are smaller.
- Retaining borrowed values for continuity.
- Step-by-step column-based solving.

#### **3. Multiplication**
- Handling partial products.
- Carrying values for multi-digit multiplication.
- Retaining intermediate products and carries.

#### **4. Division**
- Managing quotients and remainders.
- Implementing long division with step tracking.
- Handling decimal adjustments for small dividends.
