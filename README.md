## Important Update 
We are making a key change to how students/players create and access their game accounts. Going forward, students will not be able to create accounts themselves—only teachers or school administrators can do so.

To streamline this process, we are removing the in-game authentication form. Instead, students will log in using a QR code provided by their teacher upon account creation.

In the future, we plan to introduce fingerprint authentication as an option for compatible devices.
